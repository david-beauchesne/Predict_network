Long ago, in the beautiful kingdom of Canada surrounded by vast oceans, legends told of an omnipotent Golden Ecologist charged with the protection its borders. Many conquerers aggressively sought to enter this kingdom and for a while laid waste to its natural resources.

The Golden Ecologist, at the behest of Canada's rulers, sealed the gate to the kingdom. The seals should have remained for all time.

But, when these events were obscured by the mists of time and became legend, the conquerers entered the kingdom once more, only to find weakened seals.

The path to destruction is once more open, unless the full might of the seals can once again be unleashed.

The descendants of the Golden Ecologist must now protect the kingdom of Canada...

But pieces of the puzzle are missing...

Wake up... Wake up... It's time to fulfill your destiny...
